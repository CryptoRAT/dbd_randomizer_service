# dbd_randomizer_service

This project is the backend API server for the [lupogreybeard-ui](https://www.lupogreybeard.com/dbd/) and the dbd\
randomizer [mobile app](https://github.com/CryptoRAT/dbdrandomizer). It is written in Python, using the Django\ 
framework. It is backed by a postgres database.


## Build, Test, and Run Lifecycle Operations

This section outlines the typical workflow for building, testing, and running the Django application using Fabric commands. Each step corresponds to a Fabric task and ensures a smooth lifecycle management process.

### 1. **Setup and Initialization**

#### Activate Virtual Environment
Before running any other tasks, ensure that the virtual environment is activated:
```bash
fab activate
```

#### Install Dependencies
Install the required Python dependencies:
```bash
fab install
```

#### Initialize the Database (Optional)
Development uses a local db. Check out the instructions in [database docs](docs/DATABASE.md) 
to learn how to set this up.

Then run migrations:
```bash
fab migrate
```

### 2. **Build the Application**

#### Build Docker Images
To build the Docker images for your application:
```bash
fab build
```

---

### 3. **Development Environment**

#### Run Development Server (Non-Dockerized)
Run the Django development server locally:
```bash
fab dev
```

#### Run Development Environment with Docker
Run the Dockerized development environment:
```bash
fab devcontainer
```

---

### 4. **Testing**

#### Run Tests
Run all tests in the project. This will set the `DJANGO_ENV` to `test` and execute `pytest`:
```bash
fab test
```

---

### 5. **Production Environment**

#### Run Production Environment
Deploy and run the production environment with Docker:
```bash
fab prod
```

#### Apply Migrations in Production
Run database migrations inside the production Docker container:
```bash
fab migrate_prod
```

---

### 6. **Stopping the Application**

#### Stop All Environments
This command detects the current environment (`dev`, `production`, or Dockerized development) and stops the appropriate services:
```bash
fab stop
```

---

### Typical Workflow

Hereâ€™s a suggested order for running the lifecycle tasks:

1. **Setup and Initialization**:
   - `fab activate`
   - `fab install`
   - `fab migrate`

2. **Build**:
   - `fab build`

3. **Development**:
   - Non-Dockerized: `fab dev`
   - Dockerized: `fab devcontainer`

4. **Test**:
   - `fab test`

5. **Production**:
   - Deploy: `fab prod`
   - Apply Migrations: `fab migrate_prod`

6. **Stop**:
   - `fab stop`

---

### Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure the `.env` files are correctly set up for the desired environment.
- **Docker Compose Configurations**: 
  - Development: `docker-compose.override.yml`
  - Production: `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- **Database Initialization**: If rebuilding the database, ensure to apply migrations after recreation.
- **Virtual Environment**: Use `fab activate` to ensure all Python commands run within the virtual environment.



### Deployment
This project is autodeployed to a digitalocean app when a merge is made to main. This is accomplished using github\ 
actions and tools provided by digitalocean.
